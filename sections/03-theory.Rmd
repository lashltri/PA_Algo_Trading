### Moving Averages {#movingaverages}

Moving averages are among the most widely used tools in technical analysis.\
They smooth out short-term fluctuations in order to reveal the underlying trend of a time series.

The *Equal-weighted Moving Average (EqMA)* is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the last $N$ observations of a time series $x_t$ [@wildislidestradingindicators]:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sma}
MA_t(N) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x_{t-k}
\end{equation}

Each observation in the chosen window has the same weight.

The *Exponential Moving Average (EMA)* assigns more weight to recent prices and is defined as [@wildislidestradingindicators]:

$$EMA_t(N) =
\frac{1}{\sum_{k=0}^{m} \alpha^k}
\sum_{k=0}^{m} \alpha^k \, x_{t-k},  
\quad \alpha = 1 - \frac{1}{N}$$

#### Moving Average Crossings

A common trading rule is based on the crossing of a short-term and a long-term moving average [@wildislidestradingindicators].\
Let $N_1$ represent the short-term window and $N_2$ the long-term window, with $N_1 < N_2$.\
The trading position $POS_{t+1}$ at time $t$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ma_crossover}
\mathrm{POS}_{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
1,  & \text{if } MA_t(N_1) > MA_t(N_2) \ \text{(long)}, \\[6pt]
-1, & \text{if } MA_t(N_1) < MA_t(N_2) \ \text{(short)}, \\[6pt]
0,  & \text{if } MA_t(N_1) = MA_t(N_2) \ \text{(neutral)}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

## ARMA and GARCH Models {#theoryarmagarch}

Conditional Mean Equation: \begin{equation}\label{eq:armamean}
y_t = \mu
    + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i y_{t-i}
    + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \theta_j \varepsilon_{t-j}
    + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}

Conditional Variance Equation: \begin{equation}
\label{eq:garchvariance}
\sigma_t^2 = \omega
           + \sum_{i=1}^{r} \alpha_i \varepsilon_{t-i}^2
           + \sum_{j=1}^{s} \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2
\end{equation} [@wildigarch]

## Evaluation Criteria

-   **Sharpe Ratio**
-   **Maximum Drawdown**
-   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

## Hypothesis Testing

Explain what a *t-test* is and how it can be applied to compare performance metrics\
(e.g., the Sharpe ratio approximately follows a *t*-distribution under certain assumptions).
